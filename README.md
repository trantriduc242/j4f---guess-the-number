# Guess the Number Game

A simple and fun Python game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 100, and you try to guess it. The game provides feedback after each guess, letting you know if your guess is too high or too low until you guess the correct number.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation:** Uses Python's `random` module to generate a number between 1 and 100.
- **User Feedback:** Informs the player if their guess is too low or too high.
- **Input Validation:** Handles non-integer inputs gracefully.
- **Attempt Counter:** Tracks and displays the number of guesses made.
